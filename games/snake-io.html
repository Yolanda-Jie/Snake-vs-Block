                    <h2>About the Game</h2>
                    <p>
                        Snake.io is a modern multiplayer snake game where you can compete against players from around the world. The goal is to make your snake the longest while avoiding collisions with other snakes. Grow by collecting food and defeating other players to become the most powerful snake in the arena!
                    </p>

                    <h2>How to Play</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Controls:</strong> Use your mouse or touchpad to control the snake's movement direction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Collect food to grow your snake while avoiding collisions with other snakes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Features:</strong> Use boost to speed up, but it will consume length. Defeat other players to gain significant points.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start by playing defensively, focus on collecting food and avoid direct confrontations with other snakes.</li>
                        <li>Use boost wisely, especially when chasing smaller snakes or escaping from larger ones.</li>
                        <li>Watch for high-score food on the map that can help you grow quickly.</li>
                        <li>When your snake is long enough, try to trap other players, but be careful not to get countered.</li>
                    </ul>
