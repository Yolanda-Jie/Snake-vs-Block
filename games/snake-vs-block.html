                    <h2>About the Game</h2>
                    <p>
                        Snake vs Block is a modern take on the classic snake game, where your goal is to break through blocks while growing your snake. The game combines elements of strategy and quick reflexes as you navigate through increasingly challenging levels. Each block you break adds to your snake's length, but be careful - hitting a block with a number higher than your snake's length will end the game!
                    </p>

                    <h2>How to Play</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Controls:</strong> Use your mouse or touch to control the snake's movement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Break blocks and grow your snake while avoiding blocks with numbers higher than your snake's length.</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Features:</strong> Collect power-ups to enhance your snake's abilities and break through tougher blocks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Game Over:</strong> The game ends when your snake hits a block with a number higher than its current length.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
